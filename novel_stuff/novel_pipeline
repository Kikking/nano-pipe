1. Need to take your list of 1000 simulated transcripts and remove 20% of the IDs from the GTF annotation 
    Run : bash novel_maker tag (where tag is the transcript-length range)
    this makes a gtf file for each transcript range thats missing 20% of the expressed isoforms

2. To turn the 1000 transcripts into a gtf for gffcompare, run:
          bash true_maker.sh tag

2. run all the isoform tools again on the old samples, but using the respective novel gtf based on the tag in the file name
    Run : bash iso-pipe.sh q novel 
    This puts all new gtf files created in the novel folders of every tool

3. To compare the TRUE to the NOVEL annotation, run ggffcompare
   Run : bash gffcompare.sh NAME
